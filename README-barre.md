# On the Robustness of Randomized Ensembles to Adversarial Perturbations

This repository contains the code for our paper [On the Robustness of Randomized Ensembles to Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01375) by Hassan Dbouk and [Naresh R. Shanbhag](http://shanbhag.ece.illinois.edu/) (ICML 2023).

# Running This Repo
This code was run with the following dependencies, make sure you have the appropriate versions downloaded and installed properly.
 ```
python 3.6.9
PyTorch 1.7.0
numpy 1.19.2
torchvision 0.8.0
```

1.  clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/hsndbk4/BARRE.git`
2.  make sure the appropriate dataset folders are setup properly (check `get_dataloaders` in `datasets.py`)
3.  download a BARRE-trained REC of ResNet-20s on CIFAR-10 from [here](https://uofi.box.com/s/yrj4yw9woqznvnec858pvcreojld32bf)
4.  place the models in an appropriate folder in the root directory, e.g. `res20_cifar10_M5`

We are now set to run some scripts. To re-produce the ResNet-20 $\ell_\infty$ numbers in Table 1, you can run the following commands:

In order to evaluate the robustness of the trained models, please run:
```
python eval_robustness.py --M 5 --model res20 --batch_size 512 --sourcedir "res20_cifar10_M5" --outdir "res20_cifar10_M5" --normalize --use_osp
```
In order to re-produce the training outcome, please run:
```
python train_barre.py --M 5 --other_weight 1 --model res20 --batch_size 256 --outdir "res20_cifar10_M5" --normalize --osp_data_len 4096 --osp_batch_size 1024
```
